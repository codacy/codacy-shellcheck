## Argument to implicit -n is always true due to literal strings.

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [ "$foo " ]
then
  echo "this is always true"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ "$foo" ]
then
  echo "correctly checks value"
fi
```

### Rationale:

Since `[ str ]` checks that the string is non-empty, the space inside the quotes in the problematic code causes the test to always be true, since a string with a space can not be empty.

Sometimes this is also caused by overquoting an example, e.g. `[ "$foo -gt 0" ]`, which is always true for the same reason. The intention here was `[ "$foo" -gt 0 ]`.

### Exceptions:

None.
