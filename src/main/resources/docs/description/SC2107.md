## Instead of [ a && b ], use [ a ] && [ b ].

### Problematic code:

```sh
[ "$1" = "-v" && -z "$2" ]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
[ "$1" = "-v" ] && [ -z "$2" ]
```

### Rationale:

`&&` can not be used in a `[ .. ]` test expression. Instead, make two `[ .. ]` expressions and put the `&&` between them.

### Exceptions:

None.
