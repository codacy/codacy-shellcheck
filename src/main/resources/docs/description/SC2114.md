## Warning: deletes a system directory. Use 'rm --' to disable this message.

### Problematic code:

```sh
rm -rf /usr /lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg
```

### Correct code:

```sh
rm -rf /usr/lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg
```

### Rationale:

The example line of code was an actual bug in the [Bumblebee NVIDIA driver](https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/commit/a047be85247755cdbe0acce6f1dafc8beb84f2ac).

Due to an accidental space, it deleted `/usr` instead of just the particular directory.

### Exceptions:

In cases of chroot, initramfs and similar, it's reasonable to delete otherwise important directories. Due to this, Shellcheck will not warn if the command contains `--`:

```sh
rm -rf -- /usr
```

This is an arbitrary convention to allow deleting such directories without having to use a [[directive]] to silence the warning.
