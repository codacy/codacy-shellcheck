## You need a space here

### Problematic code:

```sh
if ![-z foo ]; then true; fi # if command `[-z' w/ args `foo', `]' fails..
```
### Correct code:

```sh
if ! [ -z foo ]; then true; fi # if command `[' w/ args `-z', `foo', `]' fails..
```

### Rationale:

Bourne shells are very whitespace sensitive. Adding or removing spaces can drastically alter the meaning of a script. In these cases, ShellCheck has noticed that you're missing a space at the position indicated.

### Exceptions

None.
