## This is a unicode double quote. Delete and retype it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo “hello world”
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo "hello world"
```

### Rationale:

Blog software and word processors frequently replaces ASCII quotes `""` with fancy Unicode quotes, `“”`. To bash, Unicode quotes are considered regular literals and not quotes at all.

Simply delete them and retype them in your editor.

### Exceptions

If you really want literal Unicode double quotes, you can put them in single quotes (or unicode single quotes in double quotes) to make shellcheck ignore them.
