## Braces are required for positionals over 9, e.g. ${10}.

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo "Ninth parameter: $9"
echo "Tenth parameter: $10"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo "Ninth parameter: $9"
echo "Tenth parameter: ${10}"
```

### Rationale:

For legacy reasons, `$10` is interpreted as the variable `$1` followed by the literal string `0`.

Curly braces are needed to tell the shell that both digits are part of the parameter expansion.

### Exceptions

If you wanted the trailing digits to be literal, `${1}0` will make this clear to both humans and shellcheck.
