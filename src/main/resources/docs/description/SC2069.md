## The order of the 2>&1 and the redirect matters. The 2>&1 has to be last.

### Problematic code:

```sh
firefox 2>&1 > /dev/null
```

### Correct code:

```sh
firefox > /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Rationale:

Redirections are handled in order.

The problematic code means "Point stderr to where stdout is currently pointing (the terminal). Then point stdout to /dev/null".

The correct code means "Point stdout to /dev/null. Then point stderr to where stdout is currently pointing (/dev/null)".

In other words, the problematic code hides stdout and shows stderr. The correct code hides both stderr and stdout, which is usually the intention.

### Exceptions

If you want stderr as stdout and stdout to a file, you can ignore this message.
