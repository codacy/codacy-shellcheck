## Prefer [ p ] && [ q ] as [ p -a q ] is not well defined.

And likewise, prefer `[ p ] || [ q ]` over `[ p -o q ]`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
[ "$1" = "test" -a -z "$2" ]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
[ "$1" = "test" ] && [ -z "$2" ]
```

### Rationale:

`-a` and `-o` to mean AND and OR in a `[ .. ]` test expression is not well defined. They are obsolescent extensions in [POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html) and their behavior is almost always undefined.

Using multiple `[ .. ]` expressions with shell AND/OR operators `&&` and `||` is well defined and therefore preferred (but note that they have equal precedence, while `-a`/`-o` is unspecified but often implemented as `-a` having higher precedence).

### Exceptions:

None.
