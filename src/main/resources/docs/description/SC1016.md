## This is a unicode single quote. Delete and retype it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo ‘hello world’
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo 'hello world'
```

### Rationale:

Some software, like OS X, Word and Wordpress, may automatically replace your regular quotes with slanted unicode quotes. Try deleting and retyping them, and/or disable "smart quotes" in your editor or OS.

### Exceptions

None
