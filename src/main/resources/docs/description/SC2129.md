## Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file instead of individual redirects.

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo foo >> file
date >> file
cat stuff  >> file

```

### Correct code:

```sh
{
  echo foo
  date
  cat stuff
} >> file
```

### Rationale:

Rather than adding `>> something` after every single line, you can simply group the relevant commands and redirect the group.

### Exceptions

This is mainly a stylistic issue, and can freely be ignored.
