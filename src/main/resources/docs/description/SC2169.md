## In dash, *something* is not supported.

You are writing a script for `dash`, but you're using a feature that `dash` doesn't support. See [[SC2039]], the equivalent warning for POSIX sh, for possible workarounds.

See also Ubuntu's [DashAsBinSh](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh) migration guide for how to make bash-specific scripts dash-compatible.
