It's a common mistake in JavaScript to create an object with just a setter for a property but never have a corresponding getter defined for it. Without a getter, you cannot read the property, so it ends up not being used.
Here are some examples:s

```
// Bad
var o = {
    set a(value) {
        this.val = value;
    }
};

// Good
var o = {
    set a(value) {
        this.val = value;
    },
    get a() {
        return this.val;
    }
};

```
