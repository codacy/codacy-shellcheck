## Exporting an expansion rather than a variable.

### Problematic code:

```sh
MYVAR=foo
export $MYVAR
```

### Correct code:

```sh
MYVAR=foo
export MYVAR
```

### Rationale:

`export` takes a variable name, but shellcheck has noticed that you give it an expanded variable instead. The problematic code does not export `MYVAR` but a variable called `foo` if any.

### Exceptions:

If you do want to export the variable's value, e.g. due to indirection, you can disable this message with a directive:

```sh
# shellcheck disable=SC2163
export "$MYVAR"
```
