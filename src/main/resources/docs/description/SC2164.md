## Use cd ... || exit in case cd fails.

### Problematic code:

```sh
cd generated_files
rm -r *.c
```

### Correct code:

```sh
cd generated_files || exit
rm -r *.c
```

### Rationale:

`cd` can fail for a variety of reasons: misspelled paths, missing directories, missing permissions, broken symlinks and more.

If/when it does, the script will keep going and do all its operations in the wrong direction. This can be messy, especially if the operations involve creating or deleting a lot of files.

You should therefore always check the condition of `cd`, either with `|| exit` as suggested, or things like `if cd somewhere; then ...; fi`.

### Exceptions:

ShellCheck does not give this warning when `cd` is on the left of a `||` or `&&`, or the condition of a `if`, `while` or `until` loop. Having a `set -e` command anywhere in the script will disable this message, even though it won't necessarily prevent the issue.

If you are accounting for `cd` failures in a way shellcheck doesn't realize, you can disable this message with a [[directive]].
