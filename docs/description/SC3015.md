## In POSIX sh, `=~` regex matching is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
[ "$var" =~ .*foo[0-9]* ]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
expr "$var" : ".*foo[0-9]*" > /dev/null
```

### Rationale:

You are using `=~` in a script declared to be compatible with POSIX sh or Dash.

`=~` is not a POSIX operator and is unlikely to outside `[[ ]]` in Bash and Ksh.

Use `expr`'s `:` operator instead.

### Exceptions:

None
