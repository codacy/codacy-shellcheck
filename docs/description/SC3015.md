## In POSIX sh, `=~` regex matching is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$var" =~ foo[0-9]+ ]; then
  echo matched
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Use the x-hack to handle strings like '('.
if expr "X$var" : 'X.*foo[0-9]\{1,\}' >/dev/null; then
  echo matched
fi
```
or
```sh
#!/bin/sh
case $var in
  *foo[0-9]*)
    echo matched
    ;;
esac
```

### Rationale:

You are using `=~` in a script declared to be compatible with POSIX sh or Dash, but `=~` is [not specified by POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html) and is unlikely to work outside `[[ ]]` in Bash and Ksh.

Use [`expr`'s `:` operator](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/expr.html#tag_20_42_13_01) instead.  It may be necessary to revise the regular expression because POSIX `expr` uses [basic regular expressions](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html#tag_09_03) anchored to the beginning of the string, as opposed to the unanchored [extended regular expressions](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html#tag_09_04) used by `[[ str =~ re ]]` in Bash and Ksh.

Alternately, use `case` if the matching can be done with [shell patterns](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_13) instead of regular expressions.  This avoids the need for an external utility.
