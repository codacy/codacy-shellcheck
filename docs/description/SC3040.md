## In POSIX sh, set option *[name]* is undefined.

The value *[name]* is something other than `allexport`, `errexit`, `ignoreeof`, `monitor`, `noclobber`, `noexec`, `noglob`, `nolog`, `notify` , `nounset`, `verbose`, `vi`, or `xtrace`.

### Rationale:

In a script declared to run with `sh` or `dash`, ShellCheck found `set -o` used with an option that is not defined by POSIX. The option may not be supported by these shells.

### Exceptions:

If the script has already inspected the current shell and determined the option is available, you can [[ignore]] this message.

### `pipefail`

#### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -o pipefail
if cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3
then
  echo "Success"
fi
```

#### Correct code:

```sh
fail="$(mktemp)"
if { cmd1 || echo > "$fail"; } |
   { cmd2 || echo > "$fail"; } |
     cmd3 && [ ! -s "$fail" ]
then
  echo "Success"
fi
rm "$fail"
```

Each stage in the pipeline such as `cmd1` can be rewritten as `{ cmd1 || echo > file; }` which will behave as before but now also write the exit code into `file` if the command fails.

If the file has been written to when the pipeline is done, it means one of the commands failed. This is demonstrated in the correct example.

This can obviously be extended with e.g. `echo "cmd1=$?" >> file` if the particular exit codes for particular commands are desired.

If `pipefail` or other options are used only as a sanity check, another option is to try the setting in a subshell and only apply it in the main shell if successful. This will set the flag on platforms where `sh` is linked to `ash`, `busybox`, or `bash`, but do nothing if `sh` is `dash`.

```sh
# Set pipefail if it works in a subshell, disregard if unsupported
# shellcheck disable=SC3040
(set -o pipefail 2> /dev/null) && set -o pipefail
```

Alternatively, switch to a shell that supports `pipefail`, such as Bash.
