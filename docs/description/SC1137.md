## Missing second `(` to start arithmetic for ((;;)) loop

### Problematic code:

```sh
for (i=0; i<10; i++))
do
  echo $i
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for ((i=0; i<10; i++))
do
  echo $i
done
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an arithmetic `for ((;;))` expression where either the `((` or the `))` did not come as a pair. Make sure to use `(( ))` and not `( )`. 

### Exceptions:

None.
