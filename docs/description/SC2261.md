## Multiple redirections compete for stdout. Use `cat`, `tee`, or pass filenames instead.

(or `stdin`, or `stderr`, or `FD 3`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
grep foo < input1 < input2 > output1 > output2 > output3
```

### Correct code:

```sh
# Merge inputs into a single stream, write outputs individually
cat input1 input2 | grep foo | tee output1 output2 > output3

# Pass inputs as filenames, write outputs individually
grep foo input1 input2 | tee output1 output2 > output3
```
### Rationale:

A file descriptor, whether stdin, stdout, stderr, or non-standard ones, can only point to a single file/pipe.

For input, many commands support processing multiple filenames. In these cases you can just specify the filenames instead of redirecting. Alternatively, you can use `cat` to merge multiple filenames into a single stream.

For output, you can use `tee` to write to multiple output sinks in parallel. 

### Exceptions:

Zsh will automatically `cat` inputs and `tee` outputs, but none of the shells supported by ShellCheck do.
