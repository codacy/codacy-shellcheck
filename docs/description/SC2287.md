## This is interpreted as a command name ending with '/'. Double check syntax.

### Problematic code:

```sh
df/
```

### Correct code:

```sh
df /
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a command name that ends with `/`. Since directories are not valid commands, this is always wrong.

The most common reason is bad quoting or escaping, such as in the example where a space was missing between a command and its argument.

### Exceptions:

None
