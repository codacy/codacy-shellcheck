# Couldn't parse this (thing). Fix to allow more checks.

This parsing error points to the structure ShellCheck was trying to parse when a parser error occurred. 

Make any necessary fixes and check the script again, since most of ShellCheck's functionality can only be applied to scripts that parse successfully.

See [[[Parser error]]](https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/Parser-error) for more information.
