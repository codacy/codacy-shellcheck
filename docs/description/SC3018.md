## In POSIX sh, ++ is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
i=1
echo "$((i++))"
```

### Correct code:

Write out the increment/decrement operation explicitly:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
i=1
echo "$i"
i=$((i+1))
```

### Rationale:

Prefix and postfix increment and decrement are extensions in bash and ksh. They're not supported in dash or POSIX sh, which is what your shebang says you're using.
 
### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
