## In POSIX sh, indirect expansion is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
name="PATH"
echo "${!name}"
```

### Correct code:

The easiest solution is to switch to a shell that does support indirect expansion, like `bash`:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
name="PATH"
echo "${!name}"
```

Alternatively, carefully rewrite using `eval`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
name=PATH
eval "echo \"\$$name\""
```

### Rationale:

Indirection expansion is an extension in `bash` and `ksh`, and not supported in `dash` or POSIX `sh`. Either switch to a shell that supports them, or write around it with careful use of `eval`. Take care to validate the variable name to avoid fragility and code injection.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
