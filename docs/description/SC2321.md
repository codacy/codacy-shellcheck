## Array indices are already arithmetic contexts. Prefer removing the `$((` and `))`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
values[$((i+1))]=1
```

### Correct code:

```sh
values[i+1]=1
```
### Rationale:

In indexed arrays (but not associative ones), the array index is already an arithmetic context. There is no point or value in wrapping it in an additional, explicit `$((..))`.

### Exceptions:

If ShellCheck has failed to realize that your array is associative, or if you for stylistic reasons prefer the redundancy, you can ignore this message.
