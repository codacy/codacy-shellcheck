## In POSIX sh, `&>` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
ssh host cmd &> log
```

### Correct code:

Use the long form instead of the shorthand:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
ssh host cmd > log 2>&1
```

### Rationale:

`&>` is a bash and ksh extension for redirecting both stdout and stderr. In dash and POSIX sh, use `2>&1` explicitly.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
