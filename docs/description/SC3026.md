## In POSIX sh, `^` in place of `!` in glob bracket expressions is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo foo-[^0]*.jpg
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo foo-[!0]*.jpg
```

### Rationale:

`[^c]` is frequently used in most regular expression variants to mean "any character except `c`". Ksh and Bash adopted it for globs as well.

However, strictly speaking, the only range complement syntax guaranteed to be supported across shells is `[!c]`. Dash only supports it when using `fnmatch` and `glob` from glibc.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.
Or just rewrite it to be on the technically correct side.
