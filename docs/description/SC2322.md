##  In arithmetic contexts, `((x))` is the same as `(x)`. Prefer only one layer of parentheses.

### Problematic code:

```sh
value=$(( ((offset + index)) * 512 )) 
```

### Correct code:

```sh
value=$(( (offset + index) * 512 ))
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found doubly nested parentheses in an arithmetic expression. While the syntax for an arithmetic expansion is `$((..))`, this does not imply that parentheses in the expression should also be doubled. `(x)`, `((x))`, and `(((x)))` are all identical, so you might as well use only one layer of parentheses.

### Exceptions:

This is a stylistic suggestion. If you prefer keeping both parentheses, you can [[ignore]] this message.
