## In arithmetic contexts, use `<` instead of `-lt`

Similarly, `>` instead of `-gt`, `<=` instead of `-le`, `>=` instead of `-ge`, `==` instead of `-eq`, `!=` instead of `-ne`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
if (( 2 -lt 3 ))
then
  echo "True"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if (( 2 < 3 ))
then
  echo "True"
fi
```

### Rationale:

The comparators `-lt`, `-ge`, `-eq` and friends are flags for the `test` command aka `[`. You are instead using it in an arithmetic context, such as `(( .. ))` or `$(( .. ))`, where you should be using `<`, `>=`, `==` etc instead. 

In arithmetic contexts, `-lt` is simply interpreted as "subtract the value of `$lt`", which is clearly not the intention.
 
### Exceptions:

If you do want to subtract `$lt` you can add a space to make this clear to ShellCheck: `echo $((3 - lt))`
