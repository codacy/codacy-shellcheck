##  ! is not allowed in the middle of pipelines. Use command group as in `cmd | { ! cmd; }` if necessary.

### Problematic code:

```sh
cat | ! tee /dev/full
```

### Correct code:

Either negate the entire pipeline (this is equivalent unless `pipefail` is set):

```sh
! cat | tee /dev/full
```

Or use a command group to negate a single stage:

```sh
cat | { ! tee /dev/full; }
```
### Rationale:

[POSIX specifies](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_09_02) that a status negation operator `!` is only used to negate the status of an entire pipeline, not individual stages.

By default the status of a pipeline is that of the last command, so use `!` in front of the pipeline to negate as necessary.

If you have set the option `pipefail` to OR the status of each stage together, and want to negate the status of only a single stage, you can use negate inside a `{ ! command group; }`.

### Exceptions:

Ksh supports `!` in front of individual pipeline stages. ShellCheck does not warn when the shebang declares that the script will run with Ksh.
