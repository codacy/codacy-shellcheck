## In bats, `!` does not cause a test failure.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bats

@test "test" {
    # ... code
    ! test_file_exists
    # ... more code
}
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bats

@test "test" {
    # ... code
    run ! test_file_exists
    # ... more code
}
```

### Rationale:

Bats uses `set -e` and `trap ERR` to catch test failures as early as possible.
Although the return code of a `!` negated command is inverted, they will never trigger `errexit`, due to a bash design decision (see [Related Resources](#related-resources)).
This means that tests which use `!` can never fail.

Starting with bats 1.5.0 you can use `!` inside `run`.
If you are still using an older bats version, you can rewrite `! <command>` to `<command> && exit 1`.

### Exceptions:

The return code of the last command in the test will be the exit code of the test function.
This means that you can use `! <command>` on the last line of the test and it will still fail appropriately.
However, you are encouraged to still use `run !` in this case for consistency.
