## In POSIX sh, naming functions outside [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]* is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
run-tests() {
  make test
}
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
run_tests() {
  make test
}
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

In this case, you can rename your functions to follow the same naming requirements as variables, as these are the only names guaranteed to be valid function names in POSIX.

### Exceptions:

None
