## In POSIX sh, `source` in place of `.` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
source mylib.sh
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
. mylib.sh
```

### Rationale:

`source` is a bash and ksh specific alias for the harder-to-pronounce/search command `.` ("dot")

When writing for `dash` or `sh`, use `.` instead.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
