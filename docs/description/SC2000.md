# See if you can use ${#variable} instead

`${#variable}` will be equal to the number of characters in `"${variable}"`

This is the same result as `"$( echo "$variable" | wc -m )"`
When "$variable" only contains single-byte characters, it's also the same as `"$( echo "$variable" | wc -c )"`

## example code

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env  bash

if [ "$( echo "$1" | wc -c )" -gt 1 ]; then
  echo "greater than 1"
fi

if [ "$( echo "$1" | wc -m )" -gt 1 ]; then
  echo "greater than 1"
fi

if [ "${#1}" -gt 1 ]; then
  echo "greater than 1"
fi
```
