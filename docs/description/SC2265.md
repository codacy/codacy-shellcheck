##  Use && for logical AND. Single & will background and return true.

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [ "$1" = "install" ] & [ "$USER" != "root" ]
then
  echo "Must be root to install"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ "$1" = "install" ] && [ "$USER" != "root" ]
then
  echo "Must be root to install"
fi
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `test` command followed by a `&`. This runs the test in the background, effectively ignoring it. To specify "logical AND" between two commands, use `&&`.

### Exceptions:

None
