## Semicolon is not allowed directly after `do`. You can just delete it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
while true; do; true; done

while true;
do;
  true;
done;
```

### Correct code:

```sh
while true; do true; done

while true;
do
  true;
done;
```
### Rationale:

Semicolon `;` is not allowed directly after a `do` keyword. Follow it directly with either a command or a linefeed as shown in the example.

### Exceptions:

None.
