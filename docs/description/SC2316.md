## This applies local to the variable named readonly, which is probably not what you want. Use a separate command or the appropriate `declare` options instead.


### Problematic code:

```sh
local readonly foo=3
readonly export bar=4
```

### Correct code:

```sh
local foo=3
readonly foo

readonly bar=4
export bar
```

or 

```
declare -r foo=3
declare -rx bar=4
```

### Rationale:

In most languages, declaration modifiers like `public`/`static`/`const` are keywords and you can apply multiple to any declaration.

In shell scripting they are instead command names, and anything after them is an argument. This means that `readonly local foo` will create two readonly variables: `local`, and `foo`. Neither will be local.

Instead, either use multiple commands, or use a single `declare` command with appropriate flags (`declare` will automatically make a variable local when invoked in a function, unless `-g` is passed to explicitly make it global).

### Exceptions:

If you want to name your variable `local`, you can quote it as in `readonly "local"` to make your intention clear to ShellCheck and other humans.
