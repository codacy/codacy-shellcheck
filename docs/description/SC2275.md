## Command name starts with `=`. Bad line break?

### Problematic code:

```sh
my_variable
  =value
```

### Correct code:

```sh
myvariable=value
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a command name starting with a `=`. This was likely not meant as a new command, but instead a continuation from a previous line.

Make sure the `=` is used correctly.

### Exceptions:

None, though you can quote the value to make ShellCheck ignore it, e.g. `"=foo"`.
