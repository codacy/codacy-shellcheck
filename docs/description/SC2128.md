## Expanding an array without an index only gives the first element.

### Problematic code:

```sh
myarray=(foo bar)
for f in $myarray
do
  cat "$f"
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
myarray=(foo bar)
for f in "${myarray[@]}"
do
  cat "$f"
done
```

### Rationale:

When referencing arrays, `$myarray` is equivalent to `${myarray[0]}` -- it results in only the first of multiple elements.

To get all elements as separate parameters, use the index `@` (and make sure to double quote). In the example, `echo "${myarray[@]}"` is equivalent to `echo "foo" "bar"`.

To get all elements as a single parameter, concatenated by the first character in `IFS`, use the index `*`. In the example, `echo "${myarray[*]}"` is equivalent to `echo "foo bar"`.

### Bugs:

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues/1309) with this check's handling of `local` variables, causing ShellCheck to flag variables that were previously declared as arrays, even if they are in different scopes.

The easiest workaround is to simply use different variable names. Alternatively, you can [[ignore]] the check.

It is also possible to satisfy ShellCheck by declaring the `local` variable separately from assigning to it, e.g.:

```sh
foo () {
   local -a baz
   baz+=("foo" "bar")
   echo "${baz[@]}"
}

bar () {
   local baz # ShellCheck gets confused if these lines are merged as local baz="qux"
   baz="qux"
   echo "$baz"
}
```
