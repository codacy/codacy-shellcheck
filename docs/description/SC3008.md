## In POSIX sh, select loops are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Select file to show"
select input in *
do
  ls -l "$input"
done
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to bash:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Select file to show"
select input in *
do
  ls -l "$input"
done
```

Or write your own menu.

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash. There is no simple substitution for a `select` loop, so either write your own using compatible constructs like `for` loops, or switch to a shell that supports them.

### Exceptions:

None
