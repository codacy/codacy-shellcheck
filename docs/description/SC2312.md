## Consider invoking this command separately to avoid masking its return value (or use '|| true' to ignore).

This is an optional suggestion enabled with `shellcheck -o check-extra-masked-returns` or `enable=check-extra-masked-returns` in a `# shellcheck` directive or `.shellcheckrc`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
set -e
cd "$(get_chroot_dir)/etc"
tar xf "${config}"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
set -e
dir="$(get_chroot_dir)"
cd "${dir}/etc"
tar xf "${config}"
```

### Correct code: (with correction)

```sh
set -e
dir="$(get_chroot_dir)"
[[ -d "${dir}" ]] || exit 1
cd "${dir}/etc"
tar xf "${config}"
```

### Rationale:

In the problematic example, the exit code for `get_chroot_dir` is ignored because it is used in a command substitution in the argument of another command.

If the command shows `error: Can't determine chroot` and exits with failure without outputting a directory, then the command being run will be `cd "/etc"` and the script will proceed to overwrite the host system's configuration.

By assigning it to a variable first, the exit code of the command will propagate into the exit code of the assignment, so that it can be checked explicitly with `if` or implicitly with `set -e`.

### Exceptions:

If you don't care about the command's exit status, or already handle it through a side channel like `<(cmd; echo $? > status)`, then you can either [[ignore]] the suggestion with a directive, or use `|| true`  (or `|| :`) to suppress it.
