## In Dash, echo flags besides -n are not supported.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/dash
echo -e "Name:\t$USER"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/dash
printf 'Name:\t%s\n' "$USER"
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

In this case, you can rewrite your use of `echo` using `printf`, which behaves the same across shells.

### Exceptions:

None
