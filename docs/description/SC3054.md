## In POSIX sh, array references are undefined.

(or "In dash, ... are not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
var=(foo bar)
echo "${var[1]}"
```

### Correct code:

The easiest solution is to switch to a shell that does support arrays, like `bash`:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
var=(foo bar)
echo "${var[1]}"
```

Alternatively, rewrite the logic to use e.g. indirect variable references or `set`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -- foo bar
echo "$2"
```

### Rationale:

Arrays are supported in `bash` and `ksh`, but not in `dash` or POSIX `sh`. Either switch to a shell that supports them, or rewrite your script without relying on arrays. This may not be straight forward.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
