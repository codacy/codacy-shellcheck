## In POSIX sh, process substitution is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
while IFS= read -r n
do
  sum=$((sum+n))
done < <(program)
```

### Correct code:

The easiest fix is to switch to a shell that does support process substitution, by changing the shebang to `#!/bin/bash` or `ksh`.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
while IFS= read -r n
do
  sum=$((sum+n))
done < <(program)
```

Alternatively, process substitution can often be replaced with temporary files:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
tmp="$(mktemp)"
program > "$tmp"
while IFS= read -r n
do
  sum=$((sum+n))
done < "$tmp"
rm "$tmp"
```

If streaming is important, the temporary file can be a named pipe, and the producer or consumer can be run as a background job.

If the reading command accepts input from standard input, the process substitution can be replaced with a regular pipe:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
program | while IFS= read -r n
do
  sum=$((sum+n))
done
```

### Rationale:

Process substitution is a ksh and bash extension. It does not work in sh or dash scripts.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
