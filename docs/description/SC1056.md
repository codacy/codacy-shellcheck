## Expected a '}'. If you have one, try a ; or \\n in front of it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
bar() { echo "hello world" }
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
bar() { echo "hello world";}
```
### Rationale:

`}` is only recognized as the end of a command group when it's a separate token.

If it's not a separate token, like in the problematic example, it will be considered a literal character, as if writing `echo "foo}"` with quotes, and therefore usually cause a syntax error.
