## `\t` is just literal `t` here. For tab, use `"$(printf '\t')"` instead.

### Problematic code:

```sh
# Want tab
$ var=foo\tbar
$ printf '<%s>\n' "$var"
<footbar>

$ var=foo\\tbar
$ printf '<%s>\n' "$var"
<foo\tbar>

```

or

```sh
# Want newline
$ var=foo\nbar
$ printf '<%s>\n' "$var"
<foonbar>

$ var=foo\\nbar
$ printf '<%s>\n' "$var"
<foo\nbar>
```


### Correct code:

```sh
$ var="foo$(printf '\t')bar"  # As suggested in warning
$ printf '<%s>\n' "$var"
<foo	bar>

$ var="$(printf 'foo\tbar')"  # Equivalent alternative
$ printf '<%s>\n' "$var"
<foo	bar>
```

or

```sh
$ # Literal, quoted newline
$ line="foo
> bar"
$ printf '<%s>\n' "$line"
<foo
bar>
```

or

```sh
$ # Newline using ANSI-C quoting
$ line=$'foo\nbar'
$ printf '<%s>\n' "$line"
<foo
bar>
```


### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found a `\t`, `\n` or `\r` in a context where they just become regular letters `t`, `n` or `r`. Most likely, it was intended as a tab, newline or carriage return.

To generate such characters (plus other less common ones including `\a`, `\f` and octal escapes) , use `printf` as in the example. The exception is for newliness that would be stripped by command substitution; in these cases, use a literal quoted newline instead.

Other characters like `\z` generate a [[SC1001]] info message, as the intent is less certain.


### Exceptions:

None.
