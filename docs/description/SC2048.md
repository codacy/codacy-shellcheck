## Use `"$@"` (with quotes) to prevent whitespace problems.

Or: Use "${array[@]}" (with quotes) to prevent whitespace problems.

### Problematic code:

```sh
cp $* ~/dir
cp ${array[*]} ~/dir
```

### Correct code:

```sh
cp "$@" ~/dir
cp "${array[@]}" ~/dir
```

### Rationale:

`$*` and `${array[*]}`, unquoted, is subject to word splitting and globbing.

Let's say you have three arguments or array elements: `baz`, `foo bar` and `*`

`"$@"` and `"${array[@]}" `will expand into exactly that: `baz`, `foo bar` and `*`

`$*` and `${array[*]}` will expand into multiple other arguments: `baz`, `foo`, `bar`, `file.txt` and `otherfile.jpg`

Since the latter is rarely expected or desired, ShellCheck warns about it.

### Exceptions

None.
