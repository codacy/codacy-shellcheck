## In POSIX sh, `-nt` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ Foo.java -nt Foo.class ]
then
  javac Foo.java
fi
```

### Correct code:

The easiest fix is to switch to a shell that *does* support `-nt`, like bash:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
if [ Foo.java -nt Foo.class ]
then
  javac Foo.java
fi
```

Otherwise, `find` can be used:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ -n "$(find Foo.java -newer Foo.class)" ]
then
  javac Foo.java
fi
```

### Rationale:

`test -nt` is an extension in ksh, bash and dash, but it is [not specified by POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html).

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
