## Can't have empty do clauses (use `true` as a no-op)

### Problematic code:

```sh
for i in 1 2 3; do
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for i in 1 2 3; do
  true
done
```

### Rationale:

An empty `do ... done` block is not valid.
Use `true` or `:` if you need no command at all.

### Exceptions:

None.
