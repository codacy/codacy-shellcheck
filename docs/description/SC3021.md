## In POSIX sh, `>& filename` (as opposed to `>& fd`) is undefined.

Note: ShellCheck 0.8.0 and below would trigger this warning on the perfectly POSIX compatible construct `>& fd`. If you are using `>&` to copy an integer file descriptor, please ignore this warning.

### Problematic code:

```sh
# Writing to a filename
mycommand >& log.txt
```

### Correct code:

```sh
mycommand > log.txt 2>&1
```

The following construct is also fine, as it uses an integer file descriptor instead of a filename:

```sh
fd=3
mycommand >& $fd
```

### Rationale:

There are two forms of the `>&` file descriptor operator:

* `>& integer` such as `>& 3` is a POSIX compatible synonym for `1>&3`
* `>& filename` such as `>& log.txt` is a Bash specific synonym for `> log.txt 2>&1`

If (and only if) you are using the latter form, write it out as shown in the correct example to ensure portability.

### Exceptions:

ShellCheck 0.8.0 and below incorrectly emits this warning for constructs like `>& $var`, even though this would be POSIX compatible when `$var` is an integer. In such cases, please ignore this warning.
