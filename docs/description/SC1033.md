## Test expression was opened with double `[[` but closed with single `]`. Make sure they match.

(or SC1034 for vice versa)

### Problematic code:

```sh
[[ -z "$var" ]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
[[ -z "$var" ]]
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a test expression `[ ... ]` (POSIX) or `[[ ... ]]` (ksh/bash), but where the opening and closing brackets did not match (i.e. `[[ .. ]` or `[ .. ]]`). The brackets need to match up to work.

Note in particular that `[..]` do *not* work like parentheses in other languages. You can not do:

```sh
# Invalid
[[ x ] || [ y ]]
```
Instead, use one of
You would instead use two separate test expressions joined by `||`:

```sh
# Valid basic test expressions (sh/bash/ksh)
[ x ] || [ y ]

# Valid extended test expressions (bash/ksh)
[[ x ]] || [[ y ]]
```

### Exceptions:

None
