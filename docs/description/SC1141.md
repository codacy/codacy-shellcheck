## Unexpected tokens after compound command. Bad redirection or missing `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|`?

### Problematic code:

```sh
while echo "$2"; do true; done \
  head -n "$1"

while sleep 1; do date; done > my file
```

### Correct code:

```sh
while echo "$2"; do true; done \
  | head -n "$1"

while sleep 1; do date; done > "my file"
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found unexpected trailing characters after a compound command.

The only things allowed after compound commands are redirections, shell keywords, and the various command separators (`;`, `&`, `|`, `&&`, `||`).

In the first example, a `|` was missing, causing `head` to appear as an unexpected trailing word, instead of being piped to. In the second example, a lack of quoting caused `file` to appear as an unexpected trailing word, instead of being part of the redirection.

Examine your statement and correct the problem.
