## Command name contains `==`. For comparison, use `[ "$var" = value ]`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
$a/$b==foo/bar
```

### Correct code:

```sh
[ "$a/$b" = "foo/bar" ] 
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a command name that contains a `==`. Most likely, this was intended as a kind of comparison.

To compare two values, use `[ value1 = value2 ]`. Both the brackets and the spaces around the `=` are relevant. 

### Exceptions:

None, though you can quote the `==` to suppress the warning.
