##  `[ ]` does not apply arithmetic evaluation. Evaluate with `$((..))` for numbers, or use string comparator for strings.

### Problematic code:

```sh
[ 2*3 -eq array[i] ]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
[ $((2*3)) -eq $((array[i])) ]
```

### Rationale:

When using `[[ .. ]]` with numerical comparators (`-eq`, `-lt`, etc), the value on either side will be evaluated as an arithmetic expression. This means that `2*3` will be evaluated to `6`, and `x` will be evaluated to the contents of the variable `$x`.

When using `[ .. ]`, this does not happen. `2*3` and `x` will both be considered invalid numbers. Instead, use e.g. `$((2*3))` to evaluate the expression before passing it to `[ .. ]`.

Alternatively, if the expression should be considered a string, quote the expression and use a string comparison operator like `=` and `!=`. 

### Exceptions:

None
