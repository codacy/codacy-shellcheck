## This is interpreted as a command name ending with apostrophe. Double check syntax.

(also applies to multiple other characters like `.,([{<>}])#"'`) 

### Problematic code:

```sh
var=$("wget 'http://www.shellcheck.net/'")
echo Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}
array=val1, val2, val3

```

### Correct code:

```sh
var="$(wget 'http://www.shellcheck.net/')"
echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
array=(val1 val2 val3)
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a command name ending with a symbol, such as a comma, parenthesis, quote, or similar. This is almost always due to a syntax issue in the script.

In the examples, bad quoting and invalid array syntax caused the shell to try to run commands ending in apostrophe, curly brace, and comma, respectively. 

### Exceptions:

If you have a command that *does* end in a symbol, you can ignore this message.
