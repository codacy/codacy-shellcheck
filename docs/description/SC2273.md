## Sequence of `===`s found. Merge conflict or intended as a commented border?

### Problematic code:

```sh
=======
```

### Correct code:

Either resolve the merge conflict, or use `# =======` for a border

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a series of `=======`s. If this was supposed to be a border or separator, use a comment.


However, it could also be left behind from a source control merge conflict:

```sh
<<<<<<< HEAD
echo "Goodbye World"
=======
echo "Hello World!"
>>>>>>> mybranch
```

In this case, make sure the merge conflict is correctly resolved, and all the markers removed.

### Exceptions:

None
