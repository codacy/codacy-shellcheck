## 'function' keyword is non-standard. Delete it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
function hello() {
  echo "Hello World"
}
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
hello() {
  echo "Hello World"
}
```

### Rationale:

`function` is a non-standard keyword that can be used to declare functions in Bash and Ksh.

In POSIX `sh` and `dash`, a function is instead declared without the `function` keyword as in the correct example. 

### Exceptions:

None.
