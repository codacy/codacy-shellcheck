## Use semicolon or linefeed before `done` (or quote to make it literal).

(or `do` `then`, `fi`, `esac`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
for f in *; do echo "$f" done
```
or

```sh
echo $f is done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for f in *; do echo "$f"; done
```

or

```sh
echo "$f is done"
```


### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a keyword like `done`, `then`, `fi`, `esac`, etc used as the argument of a command. This means that the shell will interpret it as a literal string rather than a shell keyword. To be interpreted as a keyword, it must be the first word in the line (i.e. after `;`, `&` or a linefeed). 

In the example, `echo "$f" done` is the same as `echo "$f" "done"`, and the `done` does not terminate the loop. This is fixed by terminating the `echo` command with a `;` so that the `done` is the first word in the next line.

### Exceptions

If you're intentionally using `done` as a literal, you can quote it to make this clear to ShellCheck (and also human readers), e.g. instead of `echo Task is done`, use `echo "Task is done"`. This makes no difference to the shell, but it will silence this warning.
