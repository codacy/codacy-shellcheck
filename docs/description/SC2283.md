## Use [ ] to compare values, or remove spaces around = to assign (or quote '=' if literal).

### Problematic code:

```sh
# Assignment
var = value

# Comparison
if $var = value
then
  echo "Match"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
# Assignment
var=value

# Comparison
if [ "$var" = value ]
then
  echo "Match"
fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an unquoted `=` after a word.

If this was supposed to be a comparison, use square brackets: `[ "$var" = value ]`

If this was supposed to be an assignment, remove spaces around `=`: `var=value`

### Exceptions:

If the `=` was meant literally, quote it:

    grep '=true' file.cfg
