## read without -r will mangle backslashes

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo "Enter name:"
read name
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo "Enter name:"
read -r name
```

### Rationale:

By default, `read` will interpret backslashes before spaces and line feeds (i.e. you can use backslashes in your string as an escape character). This is rarely expected or desired.

Normally you just want to read data _including backslashes_ which are part of the input string and have no special escape meaning, which is what `read -r` does. You should always use `-r` unless you have a good reason not to:

> -r
>
> If this option is given, backslash does not act as an escape character.

Note that [`read -r`](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/internal.html#READR) will still strip leading and trailing spaces. `IFS="" read -r` prevents this.

### Exceptions:

If you want backslashes to affect field splitting and line terminators instead of being read, you can disable this message with a [[directive]].
