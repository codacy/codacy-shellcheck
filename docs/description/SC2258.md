## The trailing comma is part of the value, not a separator. Delete or quote it.

### Problematic code:

```sh
for f in foo, bar, baz
do
  echo "$f"
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for f in foo bar baz
do
  echo "$f"
done
```

or

```sh
for f in "foo," "bar," "baz,"
do
  echo "$f"
done
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `for` loop where the items appear to be separated by commas. These will be treated as literal commas. If the commas are part of the value, enclose them in quotes, or remove them.

### Exceptions:

None
