## In POSIX sh, unary `-v` (in place of `[ -n "${var+x}" ]`) is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ -v STY ]
then
  echo "STY is set, you are using screen"
fi
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to bash or ksh, or use:
```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ -n "${STY+x}" ]
then
  echo "STY is set, you are using screen"
fi
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

In this case, `[ -v variable ]`, which checks if a variable is set, is [not specified by POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html).  It can be replaced with the portable `[ -n "${variable+x}" ]`, which uses the "alternative value if set" [parameter expansion](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_02) syntax to accomplish the same thing.

### Exceptions:

None
