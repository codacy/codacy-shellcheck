## In POSIX sh, unary `-v` (in place of `[ -n "${var+x}" ]`) is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ -v STY ]
then
  echo "STY is set, you are using screen"
fi
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to bash:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ -n "${STY+x}" ]
then
  echo "STY is set, you are using screen"
fi
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

In this case, `[ -v variable ]` to check if a variable is set can be replaced with `[ -n "${variable+x}" ]` which uses the "alternative value if set" parameter expansion syntax to accomplish the same thing.

### Exceptions:

None
