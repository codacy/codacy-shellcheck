## Stopping at 100 `source` frames :O

### Problematic code:

An initial file sourcing a second file, which in turn sources a third file, which in turn sources a fourth file, ...., which in turn sources a 100th file.

### Correct code:

Anything but that.

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a chain of 100+ files sourcing each other. It assumed there must be some internal bug, so it stopped.

### Exceptions:

If this is intentional, you can cosmetically [[ignore]] this message.
