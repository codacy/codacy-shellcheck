## In POSIX sh, redirecting from/to globs is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
date > /tmp/log*.txt
```

### Correct code:

To redirect from/to the only match of a glob, expand the glob first:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -- /tmp/log*.txt
# PS: This is a good place to verify that there was exactly one match
date > "$1"
```

Alternatively, use a loop to redirect from/to all if that was the intention.

### Rationale:

Shells differ in whether (and how) they do pathname expansion on names in redirections. Avoid the issue by expanding the glob yourself. 

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
