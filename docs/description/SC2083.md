## Don't add spaces after the slash in `./file`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
gcc -o myfile file.c
./ myfile
```

### Correct code:

```sh
gcc -o myfile file.c
./myfile
```
### Rationale:

Contrary to popular belief, there is no command or syntax `./` that runs a file.

`./myfile` is simply the shortest path equivalent to `myfile` that specifies a directory and therefore causes a shell to run it as-is, instead of trying to find its directory using $PATH.

Therefore, to run a file in the current directory, use `./myfile` and not `./ myfile`. 

### Exceptions:

None
