## In POSIX sh, `printf %q` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
ssh host "cat $(printf "%q" "$remotefile")"
```

### Correct code:

There is not really a good, built-in way to escape a string for a remote shell in POSIX sh. However, you can replace each `'` in the input with `'\''` and then wrap the whole results in single quotes:

```sh
escape() { printf "'%s'\\n" "$(printf '%s' "$1" | sed -e "s/'/'\\\\''/g")"; }
ssh host "cat $(escape "$remotefile")"
```

Alternatively, switch to a shell that *does* support `printf %q` like `ksh` or `bash`.

### Rationale:

`printf %q` is a bash and ksh extension. It's not supported on POSIX sh or dash.

### Exceptions:

If the command is gated by a check for the correct shell, you can [[ignore]] this warning.
