## In POSIX sh, set flag `-E` is undefined

(or any other option)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -EB
```

### Correct code:

Switch to a shell that supports these options, such as Bash:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -EB
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

Most shell specific `set` flags are hard to emulate in POSIX, so use your best judgement as to whether you can make do without them, or if you should require a shell that supports them.

### Exceptions:

None
