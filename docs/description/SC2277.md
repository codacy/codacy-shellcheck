## Use `BASH_ARGV0` to assign to `$0` in bash (or use `[ ]` to compare).

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
$0=myscriptname
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
BASH_ARGV0=myscriptname
```

### Rationale:

You appear to be trying to assign a new value to `$0` in a Bash script. To do this, instead assign to the special variable `BASH_ARGV0`.

If you instead wanted to compare the value of `$0`, use a comparison like `[ "$0" = "myname" ]`.

### Exceptions:

None.
