## This loops over values. To loop over keys, use `"${!array[@]}"`.

Plus companion warning [[SC2303]]: `i is an array value, not a key. Use directly or loop over keys instead.`

### Problematic code:

```sh
array=(foo bar)
for i in "${array[@]}"
do
  echo "Value is ${array[$i]}"
done
```

### Correct code:

Either loop over values 

```sh
for i in "${array[@]}"
do
  echo "Value is $i"
done
```

or loop over keys:

```sh
for i in "${!array[@]}"
do
  echo "Key is $i"
  echo "Value is ${array[$i]}"
done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `for` loop over array *values*, where the variable is used as an array *key*. 

In the problematic example, the loop will print `Value is foo` twice. On the second iteration, `i=bar`, and `bar` is unset and considered zero, so `${array[$i]}` becomes `${array[bar]}` becomes `${array[0]}` becomes `foo`.

If you don't care about the key, simply loop over array values and use `$i` to refer to the array value, like in the first correct example.

If you do want the key, loop over array keys with `"${!array[@]}"`, use `$i` to refer to the array key, and `${array[$i]}` to refer to the array value.

### Exceptions:

If you do want to use values from the arrays as keys in the same array, you can [[ignore]] these messages with a directive:

```sh
declare -A fatherOf=(
  ["Eric Bloodaxe"]="Harald Fairhair"
  ["Harald Fairhair"]="Halfdan the Black"
  ["Halfdan the Black"]="Gudrød the Hunter"
  ["Gudrød the Hunter"]="Halfdan the Mild"
)

# shellcheck disable=SC2302,SC23203
for i in "${fatherOf[@]}" 
do
  echo "${fatherOf[$i]:-(missing)} begat $i"
done
```
