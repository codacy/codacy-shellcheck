## This `$?` refers to echo/printf, not a previous command. Assign to variable to avoid it being overwritten.

### Problematic code:

```sh
mycommand
echo "Command exited with $?"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
  echo "Failed"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
mycommand
ret=$?
echo "Command exited with $ret"
if [ $ret -ne 0 ]
then
  echo "Failed"
fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `$?` that always refers to `echo` or `printf`. 

This most commonly happens when trying to show `$?` before doing something with it, without realizing that any such action will also overwrite `$?`.

In the problematic example, `echo "Command exited with $?"` was intended to show the exit code before acting on it, but the act of showing `$?` also overwrote it, so the condition is always false. The solution is to assign `$?` to a variable first, so that it can be used repeatedly.

### Exceptions:

If you intentionally refer to `echo` to get the result of a write, you can ignore this message. Alternatively, write it out as in `if echo $$ > "$pidfile"; then status=0; else status=1; fi`
