## Invalid number for `-eq`. Use `=` to compare as string (or use `$var` to expand as a variable).

### Problematic code:

```sh
read -r n
if [ n -lt 0 ]
then
   echo "bad input"
fi

if [ "$USER" -eq root ]
then
  echo "You are root"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
read -r n
if [ "$n" -lt 0 ]        # Numerical comparison
then
   echo "bad input"
fi

if [ "$USER" = root ]    # String comparison
then
  echo "You are root"
fi
```
### Rationale:

You are comparing a string value with a numerical operator, such as `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt` or `-gt`. These only work for numbers.

If you want to compare the value as a string, switch to the equivalent string operator: `=`, `!=` `\<` or `\>`.

If you want to compare it as a number, such as `n=42; while [ n -gt 1024/8 ]; ..`, then keep the operator and expand the operands yourself with `$var` or `$((expr))`: `while [ "$n" -gt $((1024/8)) ]`

### Exceptions:

None.
