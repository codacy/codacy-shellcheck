## You need a line feed or semicolon before the `do`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
for file in * do
  echo "$file"
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for file in *; do
  echo "$file"
done

# or 

for file in *
do
  echo "$file"
done
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `do` on the same line as a loop, but `do` only starts a loop block at the start of a line/statement. Make the `do` the start of a new line/statement by inserting a linefeed or semicolon in front of it.

### Exceptions:

If you wanted to treat `do` as a literal string, you can quote it to make this clear to ShellCheck and humans:

```
for f in "for" "do" "done"
do
  echo "Shell keywords include: $f"
done
```
