# Prefer putting braces around variable references even when not strictly required.

This error is optional and not enabled by default.

## Problematic code:

```shell
partial_path='example'

curl "http://example.com/$partial_path_version/explain.html"
```

## Correct code:

```shell
partial_path='example'

curl "http://example.com/${partial_path}_version/explain.html"
```

## Rationale:

If a variable gets called, and there is a string that gets appended to the variable that could get misinterpreted as possibly part of the name of the variable. Then it will not call the right variable.
