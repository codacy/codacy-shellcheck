##  Use && for logical AND. Single & will background and return true.

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [ "$1" = "--verbose" ] | [ "$1" = "-v" ]
then
  verbose=1
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ "$1" = "--verbose" ] || [ "$1" = "-v" ]
then
  verbose=1
fi
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `test` command followed by a `|`. This was undoubtedly intended as a logical OR (`||`).

### Exceptions:

None
