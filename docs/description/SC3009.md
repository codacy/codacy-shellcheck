## In POSIX `sh`, brace expansion is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

for i in {1..5}; do ...
```

Here, `$i` expands to `{1..5}`. It does **not** expand to the sequence `1 2 3 4 5`

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
i=1
# while $i â‰¤ 5 ...
while [ "${i}" -le 5 ]; do ...

  # something that will occur 5 times

  i=$((i + 1))
done
```

You can also use the `seq` command, e.g. `seq 1 5`, but `seq` is not a POSIX utility.

### Rationale:

### Exceptions:

None
