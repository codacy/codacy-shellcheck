## In POSIX sh, prefixing signal names with 'SIG' is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
trap 'handle_interrupt' SIGINT
```

### Correct code:

```sh
trap 'handle_interrupt' INT
```

### Rationale:

POSIX does not allow specifying the "SIG" prefix of a signal name like "INT". Bash and Ksh supports this as an extension.

Simply remove the "SIG" from the signal name. 

### Exceptions:

None
