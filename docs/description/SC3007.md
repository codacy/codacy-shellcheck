## In POSIX sh, `$[..]` in place of `$((..))` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
var=$[1 + 2]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
var=$((1 + 2))
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash. In this case, `$[ .. ]` can easily be replaced by the POSIX standard arithmetic expansion `$(( .. ))`.

### Exceptions:

None
