## Prefer `[[ ]]` over `[ ]` for tests in Bash/Ksh.

This is an [[optional]] suggestion. It must be explicitly enabled with a [[directive]] `enable=require-double-brackets` in a `# shellcheck` comment or `.shellcheckrc`

### Problematic code:

```sh
[ -e /etc/issue ] 
```

### Correct code:

```sh
[[ -e /etc/issue ]]
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has been explicitly asked to warn about uses of `[ .. ]` in favor of the extended Bash/Ksh test `[[ .. ]]`.

`[[ .. ]]` suppresses word splitting and globbing, supports a wider variety of tests, and is generally safer and better defined than `[ .. ]`. For an in-depth list of differences, see the Related Resources. 

### Exceptions:

This check is not enabled by default, and may have been turned on for your current project by someone who wants it enforced. You can still [[ignore]] it with a directive.

This suggestion does not trigger for Sh or Dash scripts, even when explicitly enabled, as these shells don't support `[[ .. ]]`.
