# var was modified in a subshell. That change might be lost.

### Problematic code:

There are many ways of accidentally creating subshells, but a common one is piping to a loop:

```bash
n=0
printf "%s\n" {1..10} | while read i; do (( n+=i )); done
echo $n
```

### Correct code:

```bash
# Bash specific: process substitution. Also try shopts like lastpipe.
n=0
while read i; do (( n+=i )); done < <(printf "%s\n" {1..10})
echo $n
```
In `sh`, temporary files, FIFOs or file descriptors can be used instead. When the output of the command can be stored to a variable before entering the loop, here documents are a preferable alternative:
```sh
n=0
SUMMANDS="$(printf '%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n' 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)"
while read i; do n=$(( n + i )); done <<SUMMANDS_INPUT
$SUMMANDS
SUMMANDS_INPUT
echo $n
```


With Bash 4.2+ you can also use `shopt -s lastpipe` which will change the pipe behaviour to be similar to Ksh and Zsh (see Rationale below) [as long as job control is not active](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html) (e.g. inside a script):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
shopt -s lastpipe
n=0
printf "%s\n" {1..10} | while read i; do (( n+=i )); done
echo $n
```


### Rationale:

Variables set in subshells are not available outside the subshell. This is a wide topic, and better described on the [Wooledge Bash Wiki](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/024).

Here are some constructs that cause subshells (shellcheck may not warn about all of them). In each case, you can replace `subshell1` by a command or function that sets a variable, e.g. simply `var=foo`, and the variable will appear to be unset after the command is run. Similarly, you can replace `regular` with `var=foo`, and it will be set afterwards:

Pipelines:

```sh
subshell1 | subshell2 | subshell3    # Dash, Ash, Bash (default)
subshell1 | subshell2 | regular      # Ksh, Zsh, Bash (with lastpipe=on and no job control)
```

Command substitution:

```sh
regular "$(subshell1)" "`subshell2`"
```

Process substitution:

```sh
regular <(subshell1) >(subshell2)
```

Some forms of grouping:

```sh
( subshell )
{ regular; }
```

Backgrounding:

```sh
subshell1 &
subshell2 &
```

Anything executed by external processes:

```sh
find . -exec subshell1 {} \;
find . -print0 | xargs -0 subshell2
sudo subshell3
su -c subshell4
```

This applies not only to setting variables, but also setting shell options and changing directories.

### Exceptions

You can ignore this error if you don't care that the changes aren't reflected, because work on the value branches and shouldn't be recombined.
