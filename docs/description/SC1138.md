## Shells are space sensitive. Use `< <(cmd)`, not `<< (cmd)`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
while read -r line
do
  echo "You said: $line"
done <<(cmd)
```

### Correct code:

```sh
while read -r line
do
  echo "You said: $line"
done < <(cmd)
```
### Rationale:

When redirecting `<` from a process substitution `<(cmd)`, make sure there is a space between the two `<` characters as shown in the example.

With a space `cmd1 < <(cmd2)`, is correctly interpreted as "run cmd1, reading stdin from cmd2, without forking for a pipeline".

Without a space, `<<` is incorrectly considered a here document, and `(cmd2)` is an invalid delimiter token.


### Exceptions:

None
