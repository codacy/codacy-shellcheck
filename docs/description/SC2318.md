## This assignment is used again in this `declare`, but won't have taken effect. Use two `declare`s.

(or `local`, `typeset`, `readonly`, `export`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
declare -i first=$1 current=$first
```

### Correct code:

```sh
declare -i first=$1
declare -i current=$first
```

### Rationale:

When assigning variables via a command, such as `declare`, `typeset`, `local` etc, the expansion of all arguments happen before all assignments. This means that you can't have a variable assigned and then referenced in the same command.

In the example, if `$1` is 42, the arguments will first be expanded in the current environment into `-i first=42 current=`. They will then be passed to `declare` which will perform the assignments.

To correctly set `current=$first` so that it uses the new value of `first`, use two separate commands as shown.

Note that this only applies when assigning via commands, because arguments are always expanded before commands are invoked. If assigning without a command, as in `first=$1 current=$first`, it will work as expected.

### Exceptions:

If you want to reference the value as it existed before the command, e.g. if swapping variables with `declare x=$y y=$x`, you can ignore this message. However, consider rewriting it anyways for the benefit of any humans reading the code.
