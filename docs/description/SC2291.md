## Quote repeated spaces to avoid them collapsing into one.

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo Hello        World
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo "Hello        World"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found multiple unquoted spaces between words passed to `echo`. Due to the way arguments are interpreted and passed in the shell, these will collapse into a single space:

```
$ echo Hello        World
Hello World
```

If you want to output multiple spaces, such as when creating a notice or banner, make sure the spaces are quoted, e.g. by adding (or extending) double quotes to include them:

```
$ echo "Hello        World"
Hello        World
```

### Exceptions:

If you're aware of this behavior and didn't want multiple spaces to show up in the output, you can either remove the unnecessary spaces or [[ignore]] this issue.
