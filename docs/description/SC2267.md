## GNU xargs -i is deprecated in favor of -I{}

### Problematic code:

```sh
# Implicit replacement string
xargs -i ls {}

# Explicit replacement string
xargs -imyfilename ls myfilename
```

### Correct code:

```sh
xargs -I {} ls {}

xargs -I filename ls filename
```
### Rationale:

`xargs -i` is a GNU specific option. It has been deprecated in favor of the POSIX standard option `-I`.

Note that `-i` will implicitly use `{}` as a token if nothing is specified, while `-I` requires it to be explicit.

### Exceptions:

None.
