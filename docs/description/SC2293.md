## When eval'ing @Q-quoted words, use * rather than @ as the index.

### Problematic code:

```sh
eval "$MYCOMMAND ${@@Q}"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
eval "$MYCOMMAND ${*@Q}"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck noticed that you are calling `eval` and including an escaped array. However, the array is passed as multiple arguments and relies on being implicitly joined together to form a single shell string, which `eval` can then evaluate.

Instead, prefer building your shell string with explicit string concatenation by using `*` instead of `@` for the index, such as `${*@Q}` or `${array[*]@Q}`.

This suggestion is equivalent to [[SC2124]], but for `eval` arguments rather than string variables.

### Exceptions:

None.
