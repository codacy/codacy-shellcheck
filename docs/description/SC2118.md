## Ksh does not support `|&`. Use `2>&1 |`

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/ksh
make |& tee ~/log
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/ksh
make 2>&1 | tee ~/log
```
### Rationale:

You are using the Bash specific shorthand `|&`, but your script is running with Ksh. Rewrite it to its full, POSIX-compatible form as shown in the example.

### Exceptions:

None
