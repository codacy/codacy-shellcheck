##  -e doesn't work with globs. Use a for loop.

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [ -e dir/*.mp3 ]
then
  echo "There are mp3 files."
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for file in dir/*.mp3
do
  if [ -e "$file" ]
  then
    echo "There are mp3 files"
    break
  fi
done
```

### Rationale:

`[ -e file* ]` only works if there's 0 or 1 matches. If there are multiple, it becomes `[ -e file1 file2 ]`, and the test fails.

`[[ -e file* ]]` doesn't work at all.

Instead, use a for loop to expand the glob and check each result individually.

If you are looking for the existence of a directory, do:

```sh
for f in /path/to/your/files*; do

    ## Check if the glob gets expanded to existing files.
    ## If not, f here will be exactly the pattern above
    ## and the exists test will evaluate to false.
    [ -e "$f" ] && echo "files do exist" || echo "files do not exist"

    ## This is all we needed to know, so we can break after the first iteration
    break
done
```

### Exceptions

None.
