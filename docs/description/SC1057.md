## Did you forget the `do` for this loop?

### Problematic code:

```sh
while read -r line
  echo $line
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
while read -r line
do
  echo $line
done
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a loop that appears to be missing its `do` statement. Make sure the loop syntax is correct.

### Exceptions:

None.
