## In POSIX sh, string indexing is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Your initial is ${USER:0:1}"
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to a shell that does support string indexing via parameter expansion, like `bash` or `ksh`, or rewrite with `cut`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Your initial is $(printf '%s' "$USER" | cut -c 1)"
```

To find the last argument passed to a shell script without using bash’s `${@:$#}`- or `${@: -1}`-style string indexing, use the following, which even “[works in the unix v7 bourne shell from 1979](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1853946#comment104235724_1853993)”:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
for argument in "$@"; do
  : # `:`, also called as `true`, is a no-op here
done
printf '%s\n' "${argument-}"
```

### Rationale:

String indexing is a bash and ksh extension, and does not work in `dash` or POSIX `sh`.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
