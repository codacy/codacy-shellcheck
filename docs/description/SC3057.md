## In POSIX sh, string indexing is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Your initial is ${USER:0:1}"
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to a shell that does support string indexing via parameter expansion, like `bash` or `ksh`, or rewrite with `cut`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Your initial is $(printf '%s' "$USER" | cut -c 1)"
```

### Rationale:

String indexing is a bash and ksh extension, and does not work in `dash` or POSIX `sh`.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
