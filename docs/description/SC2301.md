## Parameter expansion starts with unexpected quotes. Double check syntax.

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo ${"Hello World"}
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo $"Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a parameter expansion `${...}` that contains an unexpected syntax element, such as single or double quotes.

In the example, this was due to wrapping a translated string `$".."` with curly braces, which is not valid.

It is unclear what the intention is with invalid expansions like `${'foo'}`, `${$"foo"}`, so please look up how to do what you were trying to do.
