## Use [ x = y ] to compare values (or quote '==' if literal).

### Problematic code:

```sh
if $var == value
then
  echo "Match"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ "$var" = value ]
then
  echo "Match"
fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an unquoted `==` after a word.

This was most likely supposed to be a comparison, so use square brackets as in the correct code.

### Exceptions:

If the `==` was supposed to be literal, you can quote it to make ShellCheck ignore it:

    grep '===' file.js
