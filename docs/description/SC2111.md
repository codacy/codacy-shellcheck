## ksh does not allow `function` keyword and `()` at the same time.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/ksh
function foo() {
  echo "Hello World"
}
```

### Correct code:

```sh
# POSIX sh function
foo() {
  echo "Hello World"
}
```

or

```sh
# ksh extended function
function foo {
  echo "Hello World"
}
```

### Rationale:

Ksh allows two ways of defining functions: POSIX sh style `foo() { ..; }` and Ksh specific `function foo { ..; }`.

ShellCheck found a function definition that uses both at the same time, `function foo() { ..; }` which is not allowed. Use one or the other.

Note that the two are not identical, for example:

* Using `typeset` in a `function foo` will create a local variable, while in `foo()` it will create a global variable.
* `function foo` has its own trap context, while `foo()` shares them with the current process.
* `function foo` will set `$0` to foo, while `foo()` will inherit `$0` from the current process.

### Exceptions:

In Bash, `function foo() { ..; }` is allowed, and `function foo` and `foo()` are identical. This warning does not trigger when the shebang is e.g. `#!/bin/bash`.
