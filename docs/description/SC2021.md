## Don't use `[]` around ranges in `tr`, it replaces literal square brackets.

### Problematic code:

```sh
tr -cd '[a-z]'
```

### Correct code:

```sh
tr -cd 'a-z'
```
### Rationale:

Ancient System V `tr` required brackets around operands, but modern implementations including POSIX, GNU, OS X and *BSD instead treat them as literals.

Unless you want to operate on literal square brackets, don't include them.

### Exceptions:

If you do want to replace literal square brackets, reorder the expression (e.g. `a-z[]` to make it clear that the brackets are not special).

ShellCheck does not warn about correct usage of `[..]` in character and equivalence classes like `[:lower:]` and `[=e=]`.

### Note:

Busybox requires `CONFIG_FEATURE_TR_CLASSES` for this to work. If busybox was compiled without this feature, character classes will obviously not be available, and the correct usage is to use `a-z`, not `[a-z]`.
