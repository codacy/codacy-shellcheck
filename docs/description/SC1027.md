## Expected another argument for this operator.

### Problematic code:

```sh
[ $a -ne ]
```

### Correct code:

```sh
[ $a -ne $b ]
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `test` operator without an operand. This could be a copy-paste fail, bad linebreak, or trying to use `<>` instead of `!=` or `-ne`. 

### Exceptions:

None.
