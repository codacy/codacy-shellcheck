## In POSIX sh, `local` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
myfunc() {
  local i=0
  ..
}
```

### Correct code:

In POSIX sh, you can adopt some convention to avoid accidentally overwriting variables names, e.g. prefixing with the function name:

```sh
myfunc() {
  _myfunc_i=0
  ..
}
```

### Rationale:

`local` is supported in many shells, including bash, ksh, dash, and BusyBox ash. However, strictly speaking, it's not POSIX.

### Exceptions:

Since quite a lot of real world shells support this feature, you may decide to [[ignore]] the warning.
