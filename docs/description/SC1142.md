##  Use 'done < <(cmd)' to redirect from process substitution (currently missing one '<').

### Problematic code:

```sh
sum=0
while IFS="" read -r n
do
  (( sum += n ))
done <(file) 
```

### Correct code:

```sh
sum=0
while IFS="" read -r n
do
  (( sum += n ))
done < <(file) 
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `done` keyword followed by a process substitution, e.g. `done <(cmd)`.

The intention was most likely to redirect from this process substitution, in which case you will need one extra `<`: `done < <(cmd)`.

This is because `<(cmd)` expands to a filename (e.g. `/dev/fd/63`), and you need a `<` to redirect from filenames.

None
