## `external-sources` can only be enabled in .shellcheckrc, not in individual files.

### Problematic code:

```sh
# shellcheck external-sources=true
source /dev/zero
```

### Correct code:

Add `external-sources=true` to `.shellcheckrc`

### Rationale:

Due to its origins as an online tool, ShellCheck will by default run in a sandbox where it only reads the files explicitly named on the command line.

The `external-sources` [[directive]] allows disabling this, but must be specified in `.shellcheckrc`. This is because the sandbox would be useless if the sandboxed script can disable it for itself.

### Exceptions:

None.
