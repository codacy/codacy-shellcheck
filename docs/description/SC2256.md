## This translated string is the name of a variable. Flip leading `$` and `"` if this should be a quoted substitution.

### Problematic code:

```sh
var="foo"
echo $"var"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
var="foo"
echo "$var"
```

### Rationale:

`$".."` is a localized string, for example, `echo $"Hello $USER"` along with the proper translation files can be used to have the script say "Bonjour, youruser" in French locales.

In this case, ShellCheck found a localized string whose contents is also the name of a variable. This could have happened because the user wanted a far more common quoted substitution, e.g. `"$var"`, but accidentally switched the leading `$` and `"`.

### Exceptions:

If you do want a localized string whose contents is also an active variable, you can [[ignore]] this warning or rename the variable.
