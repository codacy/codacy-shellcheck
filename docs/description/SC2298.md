##  `${$x}` is invalid. For expansion, use ${x}. For indirection, use arrays, ${!x} or (for sh) eval.

(or `${${x}}` is invalid)

### Problematic code:

```sh
# Expecting $RETRIES or 3 if unset
retries=${$RETRIES:-3}
```

or

```sh
mypath="/tmp/foo.txt"
var=mypath
result=${$var##*/}  # Expecting ${mypath##*/}, i.e. 'foo.txt'
```

### Correct code:

```sh
retries=${RETRIES:-3}
```

or

```sh
mypath="/tmp/foo.txt"
var=mypath
result=${!var}
result=${result##*/}

```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a parameter expansion `${..}` where the first element was a second parameter expansion, either `${$x..}` or `${${x}..}`. This is not valid.

In the first example, the extra `$` was unintentional and should simply be deleted.

In the second example, `${$var##*/}` was used in the hopes that it would expand to `${myvar##*/}` and subsequently strip the path. This is not possible, and `var` must instead be expanded indirectly in a separate step, before the path can be stripped as usual. More information and other approaches can be found in the description of [[SC2082]].

### Exceptions:

None
