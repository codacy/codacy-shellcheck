## In POSIX sh, arithmetic for loops are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
for ((i=0; i<10; i++))
do 
  echo "$i"
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
i=0
while [ "$i" -lt 10 ]
do 
  echo "$i"
  i=$((i+1))
done
```

### Rationale:

C-style arithmetic for loops are a Ksh/Bash feature that's not supported by POSIX sh or dash. Use a `while` loop with separate initialization and incrementing instead.

### Exceptions:

None
