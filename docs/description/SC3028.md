## In POSIX sh, VARIABLE is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "$HOSTNAME $UID $RANDOM"
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to a shell like `bash` that supports the special variable you're trying to use, or use an external command to get the information you want:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "$(hostname) $(id -u) $(awk 'BEGIN { srand(); print int(rand()*32768) }' /dev/null)"
```

### Rationale:

The variable you are attempting to use is a special variable in bash or ksh. To get the same information from `dash` or POSIX `sh`, use an external command instead.

For `PIPESTATUS`, the pipeline can be instrumented to record the exit value of each command:

```sh
{ cmd0; echo $? > status0; } | { cmd1; echo $? > status1; } | cmd2
```

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
