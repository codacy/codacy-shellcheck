## In POSIX sh, extglob is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
rm !(*.hs)
```

### Correct code:

Either switch the shebang to a shell that does support extglob, like `bash` or `ksh`, or rewrite in terms of a loop with a `case` or `grep` match:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
for file in *
do
  case "$file" in
    *.hs) true;;
    *) rm "$file" ;;
  esac
done
```

### Rationale:

Extglobs are extensions in bash and ksh, while your shebang says you're using `sh` or `dash`. 

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
