## Use `||` instead of `-o` between test commands.

And variations, like "Use `&&` instead of `and`".

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [ "$1" = "-v" ] -o [ -n "$VERBOSE" ]
then
  echo "Verbose log"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ "$1" = "-v" ] || [ -n "$VERBOSE" ]
then
  echo "Verbose log"
fi
```
### Rationale:

You have a `[ .. ]` or `[[ .. ]]` test expression followed by `-o`/`-a` (or by Python-style `or`/`and`).

`-o` and `-a` work *inside* `[ .. ]`, but they do not work *between* them. The Python operators `or` and `and` are never recognized in Bash.

To join two separate test expressions, instead use `||` for "logical OR", or `&&` for "logical AND".

### Exceptions:

None
