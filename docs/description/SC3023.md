## In POSIX sh, FDs outside of 0-9 are undefined.

(or "In dash, ... are not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```sh
# Open FD #10 for writing
exec 10> file
```

### Correct code:

Either rewrite the script to only use FDs in the valid range, or switch to a shell that allows a larger range like `bash` or `ksh`.

### Rationale:

The shell grammar is only required to recognize a single digit before redirections to set the file descriptor, which limits the portable range to 0-9.

### Exceptions:

None.
