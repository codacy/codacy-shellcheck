## To assign positional parameters, use 'set -- first second ..' (or use [ ] to compare).

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [ -z "$1" ]
then
  $1="help"
fi
```

or

```sh
if $1="help"
then
  echo "Usage: $0 filename"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ -z "$1" ]
then
  set -- "help"
fi
```

or

```sh
if [ $1 = "help" ]
then
  echo "Usage: $0 filename"
fi
```
### Rationale:

You have a command on the form `$2=value`.

If the goal is to assign a new value to the positional parameters, use the `set` builtin: `set -- one two ..` will cause `$1` to be "one" and `$2` to be "two".

If you instead want to compare the value, use `[ ]` and add spaces: `[ "$1" = "foo" ]`
