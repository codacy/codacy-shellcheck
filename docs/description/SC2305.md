## Quote regex argument to expr to avoid it expanding as a glob.

### Problematic code:

```sh
expr "$input" : [0-9]*
```

### Correct code:

```sh
expr "$input" : "[0-9]*"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an `expr` command using `:` to match a regex, but the regex is not quoted and therefore being treated as a glob.

This means that if the problematic code is ever executed in a directory containing a file matching `[0-9]*`, such as `2021-reports` or `12 Angry Men [1957].mkv`, it will be replaced be replaced and cause the command to error or incorrectly match.

The regex should be quoted to avoid this, like in the correct example.

### Exceptions:

None
