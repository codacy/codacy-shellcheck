## Remove superfluous `(..)` around condition to avoid subshell overhead.

### Problematic code:

```sh
if ([ "$x" -gt 0 ])
then true; fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ "$x" -gt 0 ]
then true; fi
```

### Rationale:

The shell syntax is `if cmd`, `elif cmd`, `while cmd` and `until cmd` without any parentheses. Instead, parentheses are an independent construct used to create subshells.

ShellCheck has noticed that you're wrapping `(..)` around one or more test commands. This is unnecessary, and the resulting fork adds quite a lot of overhead:

```
$ i=0; time while ( [ "$i" -lt 10000 ] ); do i=$((i+1)); done
real    0m6.998s
user    0m3.453s
sys     0m3.464s

$ i=0; time while [ "$i" -lt 10000 ]; do i=$((i+1)); done
real    0m0.055s
user    0m0.054s
sys     0m0.001s
```

Just delete the surrounding `(..)` since they serve no purpose and only slows the script down.

### Exceptions:

This issue only affects performance, not correctness, so it can be safely [[ignore]]d.

If you are considering doing it to stylistically match C-like languages, please note that this is not conventional and that you'd probably recommend someone use `if (1 == 2)` over `if (system("[ 1 = 2 ]"))` in C no matter which language they're used to.
