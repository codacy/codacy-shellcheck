## `*` must be escaped to multiply: `\*`. Modern `$((x * y))` avoids this issue.

### Problematic code:

```sh
result=$(expr 2 * 3)
```

### Correct code:

```sh
# Modern, efficient, POSIX standard approach
result=$(( 2 * 3 ))

# Older, slower approach
result=$(expr 2 \* 3)
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an `expr` command whose operator is an unescaped asterisk `*`.

When using `expr`, each argument is expanded the same way as for any other command. This means that `expr 2 * 3` will turn into `expr 2 Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures 3` depending on the files in the current directory, causing an error like `expr: syntax error: unexpected argument ‘Desktop’`

The best way to avoid this is to avoid `expr` and instead use `$((..))` instead. If you for any reason prefer the 200x slower, heavyweight process of forking a new process, you can escape the `*`. Both ways are demonstrated in the correct example.
