## Command appears to be unreachable. Check usage (or ignore if invoked indirectly).

### Problematic code:

```sh
usage() {
  echo >&2 "Usage: $0 -i input"
  exit 1
}     
if [ "$1" = "--help" ]
then
  usage
  exit 0   # Unreachable
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
usage() {
  echo >&2 "Usage: $0 -i input"
}     
if [ "$1" = "--help" ]
then
  usage
  exit 0
fi
```

### Rationale:

The problematic code wanted to exit with success if the user explicitly asked for `--help`. However, since the `usage` function already had an `exit 1`, this statement could never run.

One possible solution is to change `usage()` to only echo, and let callers be responsible for exiting.

### Exceptions:

ShellCheck may incorrectly believe that code is unreachable if it's invoked by variable name or in a trap. In such a case, please [[Ignore]] the message. 

Note in particular that since unreachable commands may come in clusters, it's useful to use ShellCheck's filewide or functionwide ignore directives. A `disable` directive before a function ignores the entire function:

```
#!/bin/bash
...
# shellcheck disable=SC2317  # Don't warn about unreachable commands in this function
start() {
  echo Starting
  /etc/init.d/foo start
}
"$1"
exit 0
```

A disable directive after the shebang, before any commands, will ignore the entire file:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Test script #1
# shellcheck disable=SC2317  # Don't warn about unreachable commands in this file

echo "Temporarily disabled"
exit 0

run-test1
run-test2
run-test3
```

Defined functions are assumed to be reachable when the script ends (not exits) since another file may source and invoke them.
