## This apostrophe terminated the single quoted string!

### Problematic code:

```sh
echo 'Nothing so needs reforming as other peoples' habits.'
```

### Correct code:

```sh
echo 'Nothing so needs reforming as other peoples'\'' habits.'
```
or
```sh
echo "Nothing so needs reforming as other peoples' habits."
```
### Rationale:

When writing a string in single-quotes, you have to make sure that any apostrophes in the text don't accidentally terminate the single-quoted string prematurely.

Escape them properly (see the correct code) or switch quotes to avoid the problem.


### Additional options:
```sh
echo '...peoples\ habits.'
...peoples\ habits.
```
```sh
$ echo $'...peoples\x27 habits.'
...peoples' habits.
```


### Exceptions:

None.
