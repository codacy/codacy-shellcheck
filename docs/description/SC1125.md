## Invalid key=value pair in directive

### Problematic code:

```sh
# shellcheck disable=SC2153 (variable not a misspelling)
```

### Correct code:

```sh
# shellcheck disable=SC2153 # variable not a misspelling
```

### Rationale:

A comment at the end of a directive must be preceded by a `#`
to avoid it being interpreted as an instruction.
The [directive page](Directive#documenting-directive-use)
contains more guidance about commenting style.
