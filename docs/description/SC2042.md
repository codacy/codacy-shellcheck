## Use spaces, not commas, to separate loop elements.

### Problematic code:

```sh
for f in foo,bar,baz
do
  echo "$f"
done
```

### Correct code:

```sh
for f in foo bar baz
do
  echo "$f"
done
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `for` loop where the items appeared to be delimited by commas. These will be treated as literal commas. Use spaces instead.

### Exceptions:

None
