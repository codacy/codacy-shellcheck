## eval negates the benefit of arrays. Drop eval to preserve whitespace/symbols (or eval as string).

### Problematic code:

```sh
check() {
  eval "$@" || exit
}
```

### Correct code:

```sh
check() {
  "$@" || exit
}
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found `eval` used on an array (or equivalently, `"$@"`). This is problematic because it effectively throws away all boundary information and rebuilds it from shell words.

Let's say you invoke `check sed -i '$d' "my file.txt"`:

`eval "$@"` will:
1. Join the elements on spaces: `sed -i $d my file.txt`
2. Split the string on shell word boundaries: `sed`, `-i`, `$d`, `my` `file.txt`
3. Perform shell expansions (assuming `$d` is unset): `sed`, `-i`, `my`, `file.txt`
4. Execute the first element as the command and the rest as its arguments, as if running `sed -i 'my' 'file.txt'`

`"$@"` will
1. Execute the first element as the command and the rest as its arguments, as if running `sed -i '$d' 'my file.txt'`

Note that while `"$@"` is essentially always better than `eval "$@"`, it's easy to unintentionally introduce a dependency on bad behavior through the shell debugging anti-strategy of "adding quotes until it works":

```
# Works with problematic example because of double-escaping, fails with correct example
check ls -l "'My File.txt'" 

# Works with correct example the way it was always intended:
check ls -l "My File.txt" 
```

The correct example is still better, but the function invocation has to be tweaked as well.

### Exceptions:

If each of the array elements is a carefully escaped shell command or word, use `*` instead of `@` to explicitly join the elements on spaces which is what would happen anyways:

```
on_exit=(
  'rm /tmp/myfile; '
  'echo "Finished on $(date)" > log.txt; '
)

# Equivalent to `eval "${on_exit[@]}"`, but more explicit
eval "${on_exit[*]}"

# Even better in this case, as it does not require
# semicolons and commands don't interfere:
for cmd in "${on_exit[@]}"
do
  eval "$cmd"
done
```

If you require `eval` for another part of the command, explicitly transform the array into a series of escaped shell words. This ensures that the array elements will `eval` back to themselves:

```
# Assumed to be outside of our control, 
# otherwise we would output this in an array as well:
COMMAND='dialog --menu "Choose file:" 15 40 4'

# Our array:
array=(
  1 "My File.txt"
  2 "My Other File.txt"
)
eval "$COMMAND ${array[*]@Q}"                     # Bash 4+
eval "$COMMAND $(printf "%q " "${array[@]}")"     # Bash 1+
```
