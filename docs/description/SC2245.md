## -d only applies to the first expansion of this glob. Use a loop to check any/all.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/ksh

if [ -f ksh* ]
then
  echo "The file exists"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/ksh

for f in ksh*
do
  if [ -f "$f" ]
  then
    echo "Found a matching file: $f"
  fi
done
```
### Rationale:

Ksh has the curious behavior of ignoring anything after an unrecognized flag to `test`/`[`, which means that file checking operators against globs will effectively apply the operator to the first expansion:

```sh
[ -f ksh* ]                              # This
[ -f ksh93u ksh93u.tar ksh93u.tar.gz ]   # Becomes this
[ -f ksh93u ]                            # And is interpreted like this
```

This is an issue when you have multiple matches for a glob. Instead of checking some or all, it only checks the first result and ignores the rest. To ensure that all results are considered (either to check that *any* or *all* results match the operator), use a loop explicitly.

If you really only want to match the first result of the glob expansion as sorted alphabetically in the current locale, you can make this intention explicit:

    matches=( ksh* )
    if [ -f "${matches[0]}" ]
    then
      echo "The first result is a file"
    fi

### Exceptions:

If you only care that entries exists, use `-e`. ShellCheck does not warn in this case, since all files resulting from glob expansion necessarily exist.
