## In POSIX sh, here-strings are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
wc <<< "$1"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
wc << EOF
$1
EOF
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash. In this specific case, the here-string can be replaced by a single-line here document as shown.

### Exceptions:

None
