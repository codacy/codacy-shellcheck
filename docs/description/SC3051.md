## In POSIX sh, `source` in place of `.` is undefined


### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
source /usr/lib/myfile.sh
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
. /usr/lib/myfile.sh
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

`source` is a Bash/Ksh specific, readable synonym for `.`.  In this case, you can for the most part easily replace `source` with `.`

Do note that `source myfile` in POSIX sh only searches `$PATH`, while Bash/Ksh will additionally search the current directory.

### Exceptions:

None
