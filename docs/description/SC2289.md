## This is interpreted as a command name containing a linefeed. Double check syntax.

(or tab)

### Problematic code:

```sh
'''
This script greets the planet
'''
echo "Hello World"
```

### Correct code:

```sh
# This script greets the planet
echo "Hello World"
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a command name containing an especially unusual character like a tab or linefeed. This is most likely due to a syntax issue.

In the example, this was due to a Python style documentation string, which a shell will merely interpreted as a multi-line command name sandwiched between two empty strings.

### Exceptions:

If you have a command name that *does* contain a tab or linefeed you can ignore this message, but... wow.
