## In POSIX sh, echo flags are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo -ne 'Foo:\tBar'
```

### Correct code:

Rewrite in terms of the more robust and standardized `printf`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
printf 'Foo:\tBar'
```

### Rationale:

`echo` has historically behaved differently on different systems. Use `printf` instead to ensure compatibility between shells.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target systems that supports this feature, you can change
the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [[ignore]] this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility
warnings.
