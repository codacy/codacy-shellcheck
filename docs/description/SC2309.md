## -eq treats this as a variable. Use = to compare as string (or expand explicitly with $var)

### Problematic code:

```sh
read -p "Continue? [y/n] " var
[ "$var" -eq "n" ​] && exit 1
```

### Correct code:

```sh
#read -p "Continue? [y/n] " var
[ "$var" = "n" ​] && exit 1
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a string used as an argument to a numerical operator like `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-ge`. Such strings will be treated as arithmetic expressions, meaning `n` will refer to a variable `$n`, and `24/12` will be evaluated into `2`. 

In the problematic example, the intention was instead to compare `"n"` as a string, so it should use the equivalent string operator instead, in this case `=`.

### Exceptions:

It is perfectly valid to use variables as operands. ShellCheck will not flag any value that is an unquoted variable name assigned in the script:

    a=42; [[ "a" -eq 0 ]]  # Flagged due to quotes
          [[ b -eq 0 ]]    # Flagged due to not being assigned
    c=42; [[ c -eq 0 ]]    # Not flagged

However, ShellCheck does not know whether you intended `foo/bar` to be division or a file path. 

If you intended to divide `$foo` and `$bar`, you can either make it explicit with `[[ $((foo/bar)) -ge 0 ]]`, or simply [[ignore]] the warning.
