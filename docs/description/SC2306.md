## Escape glob characters in arguments to expr to avoid pathname expansion.

### Problematic code:

```sh
f=$(expr "$c" * 9 / 5 + 32)
```

### Correct code:

Prefer rewriting to a modern style (see [[SC2003]]):

```sh
f=$((c * 9 / 5 + 32))
```

If you do not wish to do so, at least escape the glob characters when passing them to `expr`:

```sh
f=$(expr "$c" \* 9 / 5 + 32)
```

### Rationale:

`expr` is a command so `expr 2 * 2` will consider `*` to mean "all files in the current directory". This causes the expression to fail to evaluate unless you are in an empty directory with the `failglob` and `nullglob` options turned off. 

Prefer rewriting it using the modern, POSIX standard arithmetic expansion `$((..))`. If you do not wish to do so, you can escape any characters like `*` to avoid the shell performing pathname expansion on them.

### Exceptions:

None
