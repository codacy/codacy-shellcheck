## Unexpected characters after terminating `]`. Missing semicolon/linefeed?

### Problematic code:

```sh
if [ -e "foo.txt" ]: then
  echo "Exists"
fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if [ -e "foo.txt" ]; then
  echo "Exists"
fi
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck found unexpected characters after the `]` or `]]` in a `test` expression. In the example, a colon was accidentally used instead of a semicolon.

Similarly, a missing space before a comment (`[ -e foo ]#comment`), an additional square bracket (`[[ -e foo ]]]`), or a missing semicolon before a `then` on the same line (`if [ foo ]then`) can cause this warning.

Make sure the `]` or `]]` is not immediately followed by another shell word character. 

### Exceptions:

None
