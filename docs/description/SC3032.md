## In POSIX sh, coproc is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
coproc nc shellcheck.net 80
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to Bash:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
coproc nc shellcheck.net 80
```

or try to write your script in a POSIX compatible way using named pipes.

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

There is no simple substitution for a coproc, though many use cases can be rewritten via redirection to named pipes (`mkfifo`).

### Exceptions:

None
