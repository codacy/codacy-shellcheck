## Remove surrounding $() to avoid executing output (or use eval if intentional).

### Problematic code:

```sh
if $(which epstopdf)
then
  echo "Found epstopdf"
fi
```

or

```sh
make_command() {
  printf 'cat header %q footer > %q\n' "$1" "$2" | tee log
}
$(make_command foo.html output/foo.html)
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if which epstopdf
then
  echo "Found epstopdf"
fi
```

or 

```sh
make_command() {
  printf 'cat header %q footer > %q\n' "$1" "$2" | tee log
}
eval "$(make_command foo.html output/foo.html)"
```
### Rationale:

ShellCheck has detected that you have a command that just consists of a command substitution. This often happens when you want to run a command (possibly from a variable name), without realizing that `$(..)` is for capturing and not for executing.

For example, if you have this shell function:

    sayhello() { echo "hello world"; }

Then `$(sayhello)` will:

1. Run `sayhello`, capturing "hello world"
1. Run `hello world`, resulting in `bash: hello: command not found`

Meanwhile, just `sayhello` will:

1. Run `sayhello`, outputting "hello world" to screen

Note that this is equally true if the command is in a variable, e.g. `x=sayhello; $($x)`.

If you *do* have a command that outputs a second command, similar to how `ssh-agent` outputs `export` commands to run, then you should do this via `eval`. This way, quotes, pipes, redirections, semicolons, and other shell constructs will work as expected. Note that this kind of design is best avoided when possible, since correctly escaping all values can be difficult and error prone. 

### Exceptions:

None.
